# Install Instruction

The section 'Dependencies' lists the general requirements
for the installation. The
section 'System-dependent installation instructions' gives some instructions on
how to install these dependencies on Windows, some Linux-distributions and
soon MacOS.

The section 'Specific setups' can be skipped in most cases. If you are using
a module system or MacOS there are some additional hints for the installation
process. It might be helpful to first read the section 'Installation'. The
section 'Specific setups' then helps to adjust the commands for a build on
the specific system.

The section 'Installation' then is a step-by-step guide to install mHM in the
command line.

## Dependencies

For Windows, some Linux distributions and soon also MacOS
specific installation instructions for the following list
can be found below.

- a fortran compiler
- make (a tool to compile a program)
- cmake (version >= 3.5) (a tool to create a system-dependent makefile)
- fitting netcdf-fortran libraries (libraries for the use of the data format netcdf on which mhm depends)
- (optional, but makes things much easier) git

Git is a version-control system. If you want to contribute to a project, it is highly recommended to
use Git. You can use Git to download (clone) the project to your local pc and have a look at the history or
synchronize it without copying the whole repository again. You can also download the project folder without
Git, but this would not allow you to pull updates from and push changes to our repository.

## System-dependent installation instructions

### Windows:
[Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) is an environment with a terminal that allows to compile and
run programs of Unix-like systems. You can find further instructions to install cygwin on the webpage, as well as
instructions on how to install further dependencies after the installation.

After the installation of cygwin and its dependencies mHM will be installed
using cygwin. All commands and the execution of mHM only run in that environment.

Install cygwin by executing the cygwin setup and choose the following dependencies:

- [ ] gcc-fortran (the fortran compiler)
- [ ] make
- [ ] cmake (version >= 3.12)
- [ ] libnetcdf-fortran-devel
- [ ] libhdf5-devel
- [ ] libgfortran
- [ ] gfortran

While installing cygwin you will have to choose a mirror. A mirror is a server
on the internet where the files for the installation come from. Choose any server
located near your city and when in doubt, choose the first one in the list.
In the next step you can find all available packages provided by cygwin, set
the view to "full". In the search panel you can filter the packages
by the dependencies listed above (e.g. make). When you choose a
version, the newest one is usually a good choice if not marked as experimental.

*Note for UFZ members:* Install cygwin locally (on your own computer), do not choose a location on the
network for the installation.

Some cygwin versions create a new home directory for you. You may check e.g. here:

    C:\cygwin64\home\$username

As from December 2019, step-by-step guidelines, how to install all cygwin libraries can be viewed in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/FGJOcYEzbP4)
created by Mehmet CÃ¼neyd Demirel (Istanbul Technical University).

Step-by-step mHM compilation in CYGWIN platform 

1) Change directory to mHM folder. Use single quote e.g. 'D:/mhm-v5.11.1/' if there is space in the path.
        cd mhm

2) Make a sub-directory inside mHM folder e.g. build
        mkdir build

3) Change directory to build subfolder
        cd build

4) Execute `cmake` with the path to the Git source directory as parameter. (If you followed the instructions above, the path is `..` )
        cmake ..

Other `cmake` options: 

To avoid memory issues, allocate stack memory during cmake

    cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS="-Wl,--stack,12485760" ..

If you will run mHM in parallel using OpenMP then you will need Microsoft MPI installed in your PC. Search for "Download Microsoft MPI" on internet.

Then use cmake option below. Note that memory dump is a common issue for cygwin users when compiling with OpenMP. For memory allocation please also use this line below.

    cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS="${CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS} -Wl,--stack,12485760" -DCMAKE_WITH_OpenMP=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

4) Execute `make`
        make

5) If all went well then mhm.exe must be created inside build folder. If you are in build folder then copy mhm.exe to upper folder.
        cp ./mhm.exe ..

6) Change directory to upper level and then call mhm 
        cd ..
        ./mhm

### Ubuntu, Mint and other apt-get based systems with matching repositories

    sudo apt-get install git # (optional)
    sudo apt-get install gfortran netcdf-bin libnetcdf-dev libnetcdff-dev cmake

### Archlinux

    sudo pacman -S git # (optional)
    sudo pacman -S gcc-libs netcdf-fortran cmake

### Module systems

If you are on a module system, load the modules gcc or intel depending on your
favorite compiler. Then, load the modules netcdf-fortran and cmake.

These modules will have system specific names, environments, etc.
You may use `module spider` to find the right packages and the
right dependencies, potentially use corresponding wiki pages.

#### On eve (the cluster at the UFZ)

A set of load-scripts is provided in `moduleLoadScripts`, to load all need modules for specifc compilers:

- GNU 7.3 compiler (`foss/2018b` Toolchain):
  ```bash
  source moduleLoadScripts/eve.gcc73
  ```
  or (MPI support)
  ```bash
  source moduleLoadScripts/eve.gcc73MPI
  ```
- GNU 8.3 compiler (`foss/2019b` Toolchain):
  ```bash
  source moduleLoadScripts/eve.gcc83
  ```
  or (MPI support)
  ```bash
  source moduleLoadScripts/eve.gcc83MPI
  ```
- Intel 18 compiler (`iomkl/2018b` Toolchain):
  ```bash
  source moduleLoadScripts/eve.intel18
  ```
  or (MPI support)
  ```bash
  source moduleLoadScripts/eve.intel18MPI
  ```
- Intel 20 compiler (`iomkl/2020a` Toolchain):
  ```bash
  source moduleLoadScripts/eve.intel20
  ```
  or (MPI support)
  ```bash
  source moduleLoadScripts/eve.intel20MPI
  ```
- NAG 6.2 compiler:
  ```bash
  source moduleLoadScripts/eve.nag62
  ```

Then you can compile mHM with cmake. We prepared a set of scripts, to automatize the build and compilation process to generate an executable in the root directory with the following naming scheme:

- Release version `mhm`:
  ```bash
  source CI-scripts/compile
  ```
- Debug version `mhm_debug`:
  ```bash
  source CI-scripts/compile_debug
  ```
- Release version with MPI support `mhm_mpi`:
  ```bash
  source CI-scripts/compile_MPI
  ```
- Debug version with MPI support `mhm_mpi_debug`:
  ```bash
  source CI-scripts/compile_MPI_debug
  ```
- Release version with OpenMP support `mhm_openmp`:
  ```bash
  source CI-scripts/compile_OpenMP
  ```
- Debug version with OpenMP support `mhm_openmp_debug`:
  ```bash
  source CI-scripts/compile_OpenMP_debug
  ```

### MacOS

*(to be added)*

## Specific setups

The following hints can replace the step `cmake ..` in the installation instruction.

You can skip this part and continue with "Installation", if you do not have a module system
setup (like on clusters) or if you have not installed all packages with a package manager,
such as cygwin or apt-get.

### Module systems

If you are okay with loading the needed modules as described in the section 'Module systems' above before executing the program you can skip this step and continue with 'Installation'.

The executable can be built in such a way that it does not require any modules to be loaded. The
module system, though, adds system paths in the backround the user should not care about too much, so
the setup is a workaround. (This would be the case with any other building tool aswell.)
It should be stable, anyway.

In case you want to have a module-independent build, instead of just executing `cmake ..`, either run

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_MODULE_SYSTEM_INDEPENDENT=ON ..

or

    cmake -C ../CMakeCacheFiles/eve ..

or change the variable `CMAKE_BUILD_MODULE_SYSTEM_INDEPENDENT` with `ccmake` to `ON` after running `cmake ..`.

### Non-standard locations for the netcdf-library (e.g. standard setup Macs in CHS):

Find the location of the `nf-config` file, for example by using:

    find / -iname "*nf-config*" 2>/dev/null

This searches the root directory `/` for a file with a name containing the string "nf-config" (case-insensitive). It writes error messages like "permission denied" into
the void.

Then, instead of running `cmake ..` if not using the standard compiler,
set the fortran compiler variable to the desired compiler, e.g.

    export FC=gfortran

then either run

    cmake -DCMAKE_NETCDF_DIR=/path/to/nf-config/of/used/compiler

or copy the file `specificSetup` to some other place:

    cp ../CMakeCacheFiles/specificSetup .

However, in case you want to keep it, you should choose a place
outside the build repository. Edit the file as follows:
add the path to your `nf-config` file, and after editing, run:

    cmake -C specificSetup ..

or change the variable `CMAKE_NETCDF_DIR` to the path to the `nf-config` file with `ccmake` after running `cmake ..`.

## Installation

1. Change to a directory where you want to store the source code.
2. Clone the corresponding mHM repository into a folder, either using Git (if installed):

        git clone --recurse-submodules https://git.ufz.de/mhm/mhm.git mhm/

    for cloning it into a folder `mhm`, or download and unpack it
    using the download link on <https://git.ufz.de/mhm/mhm>
    (the cloud symbol with the arrow on it).

3. Create and change to a build directory where you want to store the build, e.g. inside the Git source directory

        cd mhm
        mkdir build

    Change into the build directory:

        cd build

4. Generate a system-dependent makefile

    Execute `cmake` with the path to the Git source directory as parameter. (If you followed the instructions above, the path is `..` )

       cmake ..

    If everything worked well a Makefile was created with the corresponding paths.

    *Note: have a look at "Specific setups" above in case you are using module systems,
    or when the netcdf libraries are not located where the package manager usually installs libraries,
    or when they are not saved in environment variables (i.e., classical MacOS setups at CHS).*

5. Make the build:

   Execute make:

        make

    If this also worked fine, an executable was created, which has to be moved or copied to the Git source directory.

6. Execute the file:

        cd ..
        cp build/mhm .

    On Windows the executable is called `mhm.exe` instead of `mhm`. In that case
    instead of `cp build/mhm .` execute

        cp build/mhm.exe .

    Now you might execute mHM:

        ./mhm

*Note concerning the development of the cmake setup: one could automatically
 link the executable with the `cmake` code inside the Git source directory
  which is not done for two reasons:*

- *The executable depends on your local system, so it should never be commited and pushed to other users.
    Nothing should be built inside the source directory automatically.*
- *The directory where mHM is executed usually is not the source directory but the directory where you want to run
   your tests. In case of the test setup it is the same, usually it is not.*

## Building Realease or Debug versions

If you want to set up specific versions of the build, you can
create different folders for that. In case a release and a debug version need to be set up, it makes sense to create two folders named `debug` and `release`.

    mkdir release

    mkdir debug

inside the `release` folder one would execute

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

and inside the `debug` folder

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

Executing

    make

in the corresponding folder would then always result in a release build or respectively in a debug build.

## Troubleshooting

**cmake** is far from being my main task, so it will probably take a while until I can track a problem.
Nonetheless, I would be happy having bug reports. Feel free to write an email to <mailto:maren.kaluza@ufz.de> if there are any bugs, remarks or questions.

### MacOS, homebrew

On brew/homebrew setup MacOS systems a working nf-config is not yet available at this time. Execute:

    nf-config --all

and if it says something like "is not implemented yet" the issue is not solved yet. But it is on my tracklist.

### cygwin

If libraries are not found, the problem can be:
- you accidentally tried to use commands within the cmd shell and not within the cygwin shell
- your cygwin setup might be broken. Try deinstalling, following the instructions <https://cygwin.com/faq/faq.html#faq.setup.uninstall-service>, and reinstalling again. During
reinstallation only install the required dependencies.
