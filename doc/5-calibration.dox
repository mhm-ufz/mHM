\section paramopt Calibration of Parameters on Observations

In order to use the calibration feature of mHM, turn the <code>optimize</code> switch in <code>mhm.nml</code> to
<code>.true.</code>.

\subsection Parameters

MHM calibrates all parameters in <code>mhm_parameters.nml</code> which are flagged for optimization (column
"FLAG"). Parameters can be forced to stay constant during calibration by setting the flag to 0. The upper and lower
bounds define the ranges in within which the optimization methods vary the parameters. Although permitted, we recommend
not to change the bounds, since they are the result of intensive sensitivity studies covering a wide range of basins.

\subsection Methods

Different optimization methods are available to find the best configuration of parameters for the selected objective
function. You may chose between Simulated Annealing (SA), Dynamically Dimensioned Search (DDS) and Shuffled Complex
Evolution algorithm (SCE). Details about these methods can be found in the module description part of this manual. At the
very end of <code>mhm.nml</code> additional settings are offered for optimization.

\subsection Objective Functions

The measure to define how well a quantity fits to the observations depends strongly on the specific type of
application. mHM offers a variety of options for different quantities like discharge, soil moisture, or total water
storage. For example, an NSE type of function will not be able to catch low values as well as ln(NSE) would. In
<code>mhm.nml</code>, individual objective functions are defined for specific quantities.

\subsection Observation Data

Discharge and total water storage data should be provided in ASCII file format for each gauge/basin. Soil moisture and
neutron data need to be provided as spatio-temporal netcdf files. Example files can be found in thr folder
<code>optional_data</code> in the <code>test_basin</code>. Furthermore, a <code>optional_data</code> namelist in
<code>mhm.nml</code> provides several options regarding the handling of such data. For example, for soil moisture data,
the temporal resolution needs to be set in <code>mhm.nml</code>. However, neutron data is restricted to be daily in the
current release. The spatial resolution of soil moisture and neutrons data needs to match the hydrological resolution of
mHM.

For correct preparation of input data, please take a look at the input data in the <code>test_basin</code>, which will
serve as a good example. Furthermore, it could be helpful to generate optional data files from precedent mHM output,
because then the temporal resolution and the spatial grid is guaranteed to match the needs of mHM. The files then can be
modified with tools like <code>cdo</code> or <code>python</code>.

\subsection Output

Calibration runs result in a parameter file called <code>FinalParams.nml</code> which contains the optimized parameter
set. Replace <code>mhm_parameters.nml</code> with <code>FinalParams.nml</code>, then run mHM in forward mode in order
to obtain hydrologic predictions.
